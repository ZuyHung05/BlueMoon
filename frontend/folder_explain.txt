api/

Purpose: Encapsulates functions that call backend APIs or provide client-side API helpers.
Typical contents: modules that export request functions or endpoint wrappers (e.g., menu.js).
Usage: Imported by views, hooks, or layout components to fetch data (menu items, user info, etc.). Keeps HTTP code centralized.
assets/

Purpose: Static assets (images, icons, styles, fonts) used by the UI.
Typical contents: images/ (avatars, icons, auth images), scss/ (global and theme styles like _themes-vars.module.scss and style.scss).
Usage: Referenced from components and layout for icons, backgrounds, and global styles. SCSS provides theming variables and base styles.
contexts/

Purpose: React Context providers to hold app-wide state/config values.
Typical contents: provider components and context definitions (e.g., ConfigContext.jsx).
Usage: Wraps the app (in App.jsx/index.jsx) to expose config or theme settings via useContext.
hooks/

Purpose: Custom React hooks (reusable logic extracted from components).
Typical contents: hooks for config (useConfig.js), local storage, menu collapse state, script refs, etc.
Usage: Components import these hooks to manage local or shared behavior in a consistent way (e.g., persistent UI state, side effects).
layout/

Purpose: All layout components and page scaffolding (header, sidebar, content area, footers).
Typical contents (subfolders):
Customization/ – UI controls for customizing theme/appearance (border radius, font family).
MainLayout/ – Main layout components (Header, Sidebar, MainContentStyled, Footer, HorizontalBar).
MinimalLayout/ – Minimal layout variant for simple pages (login, plain pages).
NavigationScroll.jsx – helper for scroll behavior.
LogoSection/, MenuList/, Sidebar/ – navigation and menu related pieces.
Usage: Assembles the app skeleton and organizes where routes/pages are rendered. Layout components handle responsiveness, nav, and top-level UI chrome.
menu-items/

Purpose: Centralized menu / navigation configuration.
Typical contents: JS modules that define menu structures for dashboard, utilities, pages, etc. (e.g., dashboard.js, pages.js, index.js).
Usage: Used by MenuList/Sidebar to build navigation; can be used to generate routes or permission-based menus.
routes/

Purpose: Route definitions and routing helpers for the app.
Typical contents: Route components and route trees (MainRoutes.jsx, AuthenticationRoutes.jsx, index.jsx, ErrorBoundary.jsx).
Usage: Provide React Router route trees and route wrappers (auth protection, error boundaries) used by the top-level App.jsx.
store/

Purpose: Central place for app constants and lightweight store items.
Typical contents: small constant files like constant.js. (This repo appears to use React Context/hooks more than a heavy state library.)
Usage: Shared constants (roles, keys, default values) used throughout UI and logic.
themes/

Purpose: Theme system for Material UI or the styling solution used by the template.
Typical contents: theme entry (index.jsx), palette.jsx, typography.jsx, custom-shadows.jsx, and many overrides/ for component-level customization (Button, Card, DataGrid, etc.).
Usage: The theme is created and injected into the app (e.g., via MUI ThemeProvider) to ensure consistent colors, spacing, typography, and component theming.
ui-component/

Purpose: Reusable UI components and shared UI building blocks.
Typical contents: Loader, Logo, Loadable wrapper, a cards/ subfolder with different card components and skeletons, extended/ components (higher-level composed UI bits), and third-party/ integrations (like SimpleBar.jsx).
Usage: Imported by pages and layout code to compose pages; these are the building blocks of the UI (buttons, cards, modals, lists).
utils/

Purpose: Utility functions and small pure helpers.
Typical contents: helper modules like colorUtils.js, getImageUrl.js, password-strength.js.
Usage: Utility functions consumed across components/hooks for non-React logic (formatters, color transforms, asset URL helpers).
views/

Purpose: The app pages and view-level components (the actual screens the user visits).
Typical contents: subfolders for dashboard/, pages/ (auth forms, authentication examples), sample-page/, utilities/ components (Color, Shadow, Typography).
Usage: These are plugged into the routes and rendered within the layout components.
