✅ Exactly — you’ve got it 100% right.

When a user signs in, your React app:
1️⃣ receives their role (e.g., "admin", "manager", "accountant") from the backend,
2️⃣ saves it (usually in localStorage, Context, or Redux),
3️⃣ then decides which page, dashboard, or route to show — all based on that role.
